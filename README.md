## How to Use

Just type the words and the completion suggestions should show up. If you still don't understand how to use it. Just flow along.

> **Note:** For best result, you can disable [Matlab Completions](https://github.com/tushortz/Matlab-Completions/) (if installed) so that only the GUI methods would show up in the completion lists.
